### EXP-401 Preparation Repository
 A bunch of resources to prepare for the OSEE certification, Offensive Security's hardest course. I will personally use this repository myself, and upload my own proof-of-concept exploits for some of these bugs. I will also be actively updated this repository with more resources and other suggested exploits to try out yourself!

### Course Overview
 "Modern exploits for Windows-based platforms require modern bypass methods to circumvent Microsoft’s defenses. In Advanced Windows Exploitation (EXP-401), OffSec challenges students to develop creative solutions that work in today’s increasingly difficult exploitation environment.

 The case studies in AWE are large, well-known applications that are widely deployed in enterprise networks. The course dives deep into topics ranging from security mitigation bypass techniques to complex heap manipulations and 64-bit kernel exploitation.

 AWE is a particularly demanding penetration testing course. It requires a significant amount of student-instructor interaction. Therefore, we limit AWE courses to a live, hands-on environment.

 This is the hardest course we offer and it requires a significant time investment. Students need to commit to reading case studies and reviewing the provided reading material each evening."
